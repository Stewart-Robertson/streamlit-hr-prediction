# Business Turnover & Savings Estimator

> Predict employee attrition risk, run what-if scenarios, and quantify net savings under real-world budget constraints.

This project showcases a practical, decision-support data product aimed at HR leadership and Finance‚Äîclear enough for non-technical users, with enough detail for analysts to trust.

> **Built fast by partnering with AI.**
> I intentionally used AI as a collaborative teammate throughout this project‚Äîaccelerating planning, coding, documentation, and iteration.
> This repo is a transparent example of how a data analyst can ship useful, end-to-end products quickly by pair-programming with AI while owning the design, reasoning, and validation.

## ‚ú® What This App Does

- **Scores attrition risk** for each employee using a calibrated logistic regression model (time-aware split: train ‚â§ 2022, test 2023)

- **Two targeting strategies:**
  - **Threshold**: Treat everyone above a chosen risk level
  - **Top-K**: Treat the highest-risk K% with optional coverage

- **Savings Sandbox**: Adjust replacement cost multiple, intervention cost, effectiveness, planning horizon (months), and monthly vs total spend

- **Economically optimal threshold**: Compute the profit-maximizing cut-off from your assumptions

- **What-if scenarios**: Test impact of reducing workload and improving manager quality; the model includes an engineered manager √ó workload interaction

- **Interpretability for stakeholders:**
  - "Executive summary" with Net savings, Flagged, Precision, Recall
  - ROC curve and Lift by decile with plain-language explainers
  - Threshold-free (coverage-adjusted) savings for Top-K pilots

## üß† Model & Methodology

### Algorithm
- **Logistic Regression** with one-hot encoding + scaling
- **Probability calibration** (sigmoid or isotonic) using next-year data

### Validation
- **Time-based split**: Train ‚â§ 2022, test 2023
- **Option for grouped CV** by team to guard against team-level leakage

### Feature Engineering
- Dropped leaky columns (e.g., exit interview, offboarding)
- Reduced multicollinearity (comp/benefits stack)
- Added `mgmt_workload_score` (worse manager √ó higher workload)

### Performance (Live in App)
- **AUC**: ‚âà 0.65‚Äì0.68
- **Strong lift** in top deciles
- **Good calibration** (predicted ‚âà observed)

## üíµ Savings Math (Stakeholder-Friendly)

### Net Savings (Scenario)
Threshold-based calculation:
```
Net = TP √ó effectiveness √ó replacement_cost ‚àí (TP+FP) √ó intervention_cost
```

### Threshold-Free Savings (Coverage-Adjusted)
Top-K or Threshold cohort with Coverage %; sums per-person expected value from risk reductions (even if not crossing a threshold).

### Planning Horizon
- **Costs scale** to your selected months (e.g., 3-month view)
- **Replacement cost**: `avg_salary √ó replacement_multiple √ó (horizon/12)`
- **Intervention cost**: Total program cost or monthly √ó horizon (toggle in UI)
- **Economically optimal threshold**: Computed from current assumptions; offered as reference

## üß≠ How to Use (2-Minute Tour)

1. **Set assumptions** in the left sidebar: replacement multiple, intervention cost, effectiveness, horizon (months)

2. **Choose strategy**: Threshold or Top-K (with Coverage %)

3. **Use what-if levers**: Reduce workload, improve manager quality; watch risk & savings update

4. **Read executive summary**: Net savings, Flagged, Precision/Recall; then check Model performance (ROC, Lift)

5. **Make a plan**: Start with Top-K + Coverage for a targeted pilot; export Top-risk employees

## ü§ù Partnering with AI

I used AI intentionally as a **force multiplier**‚Äîfor scaffolding code, surfacing edge cases, and tightening copy. The workflow was iterative:

- **I defined** goals, constraints, and tests
- **AI accelerated** the implementation  
- **I validated**, refactored, and documented

This project reflects how analysts can **own the problem and the standard**, while co-building with AI to deliver value fast.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics, Fairness & Scope

- This app is **decision support**‚Äînot an automated decision system
- Data here is synthetic; in production, ensure bias audits, legal review, and employee privacy protections
- Avoid using sensitive or prohibited attributes
- Provide appeal and human review for any flagged list
