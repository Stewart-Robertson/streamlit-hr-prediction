# How to use

## 1) Set assumptions (left sidebar)
- **Intervention cost** – average cost per person for your retention program
- **Effectiveness** – chance the program prevents an otherwise likely leaver
- **Replacement cost** – cost to replace a leaver (recruitment + onboarding + lost productivity)

!!! tip "Breakeven"
    A person becomes economically worth treating when  
    `risk ≥ cost / (effectiveness × replacement_cost)`.

## 2) Pick an intervention strategy
- **Threshold**: treat everyone above a chosen risk.  
- **Top-K**: treat the highest-risk K% (e.g., top 15%).  
- **Coverage %**: the portion of that group you can actually reach.

## 3) Explore what-if levers
- **Reduce workload score** – simulate capacity relief  
- **Improve manager quality** – simulate coaching/leadership support

The charts update instantly. Use the **Δ Net savings** and **Risk change** panels to judge ROI.

## 4) Interpret the results
- **Net savings (base)** – expected savings with current settings *before* applying what-ifs.  
- **Net savings (scenario)** – expected savings *after* applying what-ifs.  
- **Δ Net savings** – difference between scenario and base (positive = better).  
- **Threshold-free savings** – probability-weighted expected value over the treated cohort (doesn’t depend on a single cut-off).

See **[Savings explained](savings.md)** for plain-English examples.

## 5) Decide & act
- Start with **Top-K** targeting and a modest **Coverage** to pilot capacity.
- Download the top-risk list (Individuals tab), brief managers, schedule the program.
