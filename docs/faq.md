# **FAQ**

**Is the model “deciding” who to keep?**  
No. It’s decision support. Managers and HR choose actions.

**Why do savings change when I switch to Top-K?**  
Because you’re treating a different cohort (highest-risk first), which often increases ROI.

**Why does Δ Net savings show 0 sometimes?**  
Your scenario didn’t move many people across the threshold. See the threshold-free number for a more sensitive comparison.
