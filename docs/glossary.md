**Attrition risk** – probability a person will leave.  
**Effectiveness** – chance an intervention prevents an otherwise likely leaver.  
**Replacement cost** – money lost when someone leaves (recruitment, onboarding, productivity).  
**Top-K** – the highest-risk K% of employees.  
**Coverage** – % of the targeted cohort you can treat.  
**Threshold-free savings** – probability-weighted expected value across the treated group.  
**TP** – True Positives.  
**FP** – False Positives.  
**TN** – True Negatives.  
**FN** – False Negatives.  
**Precision** – TP / (TP + FP) i.e., how often the model correctly identifies a leaver.  
**Recall** – TP / (TP + FN) i.e., the proportion of all leavers correctly identified.
