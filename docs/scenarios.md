# **What-if scenarios & strategies**

## Levers
- **Workload**: lower scores reduce risk most for overworked teams
- **Manager quality**: improvements matter most where baseline is weak

## Strategies
- **Threshold**: aligns with policy (“intervene above X% risk”)
- **Top-K**: fixes capacity (“we can treat ~15% of employees”)
- **Coverage**: simulate partial rollout to the chosen cohort

!!! tip
    Try Top-K first. It naturally targets the highest ROI group.
